# UnityWindowsCapture
A framework to capture individual windows or the entire desktop in Unity.

Right now this uses GDI in an optimized way to capture things on windows 7+. As long as you are careful about your capturing rates you can run at 40-50 fps. I also have code for using the Desktop Capture API (Windows 8+) but I'm still cleaning that up then I'll add it here too.

See ExampleUsage.cs in the scene "Test" for an example of how to use this. I'll add a more detailed tutorial later as well.
